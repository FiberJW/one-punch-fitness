It took me three years to get this strong. One hundred push-ups! One hundred sit-ups! One hundred squats! Then a 10 kilometer run! Every single day! And of course, make sure you eat three meals a day. Just a banana in the morning is fine. But the most important thing is  to never use the a.c. or heat in the summer or winter so that you can strenghten the mind. In the beginning, you'll wish you were dead. You might start thinking, what's the harm of taking a day off? But for me, in order to be a strong hero, no matter how tough it was even if I was spitting blood, I never stopped. I kept doing squats even when my legs were so heavy they refused to move. Even when my arms started making weird clicking noises, I kept doing push-ups. A year and a half later, I started to notice a difference. I was bald ... and I had become stronger. In other words, you gotta train like hell to the point where your hair falls out. That's the only way to become strong.\n\n- Saitama,\n\t\"Someone who is a hero for fun.\"",
